## About

**unifi-cam-proxy** adds UniFi Protect compatibility to non-UniFi cameras. It goes beyond the basic third-party camera functionality of UniFi Protect for ONVIF Cameras added by Ubiquiti. Key features include:

1. **Simulates a Ubiquiti camera** in order to work with Protect.
2. **Motion detection** allows recording only when motion is detected.
3. **Smart detections** enable recording when people or cars are detected, for example.
4. **Custom support** for certain cameras, like Hikvision.
5. **Supports any RTSP camera**, even without ONVIF support.
6. **Multiple instance support** for adding multiple NVR/DVR cameras to Protect â€” useful since ONVIF support typically limits to one camera per ONVIF device.
